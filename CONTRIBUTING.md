# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, great! Feel free to add your own folder for the specific topic you are covering, or rework an old one!

Topics I plan to add:
- RSA (done)
- DH (might work more)
- ECC (working)
- Hashing (not started)
- Block ciphers (not started)
- XOR (not started)
- Modular maths shenanigans and maybe stuff like that? (not started)
- Lattices (will never do)
