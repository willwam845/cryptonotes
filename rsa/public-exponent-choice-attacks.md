# High E attacks

again, just script go brrr attacks

## Attacks on High E

When the exponent is something very large, there are two main attacks we can use. One is the weiner attack, and the other is the Boneh-Durfee attack.

### Wiener

The wiener attack exists, tends to be quite reliable. [https://github.com/pwang00/Cryptographic-Attacks/blob/master/Public%20Key/RSA/wiener.sage](https://github.com/pwang00/Cryptographic-Attacks/blob/master/Public%20Key/RSA/wiener.sage) here's an implementation

### Boneh-Durfee

The Boneh-Durfee attack also exists, but it's pretty unreliable [https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps/blob/master/HSCTF/crypto/Chonky%20E/boneh\_durfee.sage](https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps/blob/master/HSCTF/crypto/Chonky%20E/boneh_durfee.sage) here's an implementation

they both involve lattices and lattices are scary so uh yeah im not explaining them

### Multi-Prime Wiener attack

it exists one sec ill do it later
